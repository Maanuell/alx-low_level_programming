malloc returns a void pointer to the allocated space, or NULL if there's insufficient memory available. To return a pointer to a type other than void, use a type cast on the return value. The storage space pointed to by the return value is suitably aligned for storage of any type of object that has an alignment requirement less than or equal to that of the fundamental alignment. (In Visual C++, the fundamental alignment is the alignment that's required for a double, or 8 bytes. In code that targets 64-bit platforms, it's 16 bytes.) Use _aligned_malloc to allocate storage for objects that have a larger alignment requirementâ€”for example, the SSE types __m128 and __m256, and types that are declared by using __declspec(align( n )) where n is greater than 8. If size is 0, malloc allocates a zero-length item in the heap and returns a valid pointer to that item. Always check the return from malloc, even if the amount of memory requested is small.
